## Overview

This is the code for our proposed PairingNet

## Usage

1. **Prepare Data:**
Download the dataset and then modify the data set path in the config file

2. **Run the Code:** 

```bash
python run.py
```

3. **View Results:**
After completion, use matching_test.py and searching_test.py to get the final result.


## Notes

- Ensure that a Python environment is installed and has the necessary permissions.

- Make sure the fragmented image data for testing is placed in the correct directory as expected.

- The code may require significant computational resources, especially for large-scale fragmented image datasets.
