This repo contains official code and datasets for the ECCV 2024 paper [PairingNet: A Learning-based Pair-searching and -matching Network for Image Fragments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08704).

We propose a learning-based image fragment pair-searching and -matching approach to solve the challenging restoration problem. Existing works use rule-based methods to match similar contour shapes or textures, which are always difficult to tune hyperparameters for extensive data and computationally time-consuming. Therefore, we propose a neural network that can effectively utilize neighbor textures with contour shape information to fundamentally improve performance. First, we employ a graph-based network to extract the local contour and texture features of fragments. Then, for the pair-searching task, we adopt a linear transformer-based module to integrate these local features and use contrastive loss to encode the global features of each fragment. For the pair-matching task, we design a weighted fusion module to dynamically fuse extracted local contour and texture features, and formulate a similarity matrix for each pair of fragments to calculate the matching score and infer the adjacent segment of contours. To faithfully evaluate our proposed network, we collect a real dataset and generate a simulated image fragment dataset through an algorithm we designed that tears complete images into irregular fragments. The experimental results show that our proposed network achieves excellent pair-searching accuracy, reduces matching errors, and significantly reduces computational time.

## Installation
We tested on a server configured with Ubuntu 20.04, cuda 11.6 and gcc 9.3.0. Other similar configurations should also work.
1. Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/zhourixin/PairingNet.git

```


## Dataset
The generated fragments dataset and real fragments dataset can be downloaded [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhourxin/Fragments-dataset). It consists of 8196 generated fragments of 390 PNG images and 320 real fragments of 34 printed images. The generated fragments dataset is divided into train set, validation set and test set.
